## MacSpresso
MacSpresso is a simple menu bar app that keeps your Mac awake, allowing long-running processes to finish up without interruption.

MacSpresso lives and dies in your menu bar. When the mug is visible, caffeination is active. Otherwise the app is closed, preventing menu bar clutter. 

## Installation
------------
**Note:** In macOS Sequoia, Option-click no longer works to open unsigned apps. If Gatekeeper wont let you open the app for the first time, go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and click **“Open Anyway”** to allow it to run.

Install MacSpresso via Homebrew:
  ```bash
  brew install krisapa/tap/macspresso --cask
  ```
  Or tap my respository first, then install:
  ```bash
  brew tap krisapa/tap
  brew install --cask macspresso
  ```

Or download the latest `.dmg` file from [Releases](https://github.com/6b70/MacSpresso/releases)

You can also clone the entire repository and build it yourself:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/6b70/MacSpresso.git
```
